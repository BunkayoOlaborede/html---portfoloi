    <h3>Me before you</h3>
    <h4>This is my favorite movie because it is such a classis romance movie. I love british romance movies because the have an elegance and dreamy style to them. 
        I love this in particular because it depicts true love and soundtrack is by one of my favorite composorts of all time. </h4>

    <h3>The fault in our stars</h3>
    <h4> I particularly enjoy this movie because i read the book before watching the movie. 
        Although, the book is better in my opinion, it was still super cool to see someone elses vision become a visual reality.
